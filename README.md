# 🔐 DVWA-Web-Application-Security-Testing-Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates hands-on web application security testing using *DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)* in a controlled lab environment on *Kali Linux*.

The purpose of this project is to gain practical experience in identifying, testing, and understanding common web vulnerabilities using industry-recognized tools.

This project is ideal for beginner cybersecurity learners and showcases practical offensive security skills for interviews, internships, and GitHub portfolios.

•⁠  ⁠Practice manual security testing techniques.

•⁠  ⁠Learn HTTP request/response interception.

•⁠  ⁠Gain experience with penetration testing tools.

•⁠  ⁠Document findings professionally.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used


•⁠  ⁠Kali Linux

•⁠  ⁠Firefox Browser

•⁠  ⁠MariaDB

•⁠  ⁠Apache / DVWA Service

## 1️⃣ DVWA Security Level: Low

### 📌 Configuration

The DVWA security level was configured to *Low* to enable beginner-friendly testing of common web vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment.

### 🎯 Purpose


This setting was used to practice:

•⁠  ⁠SQL Injection  

•⁠  ⁠Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  

•⁠  ⁠Command Injection  

•⁠  ⁠Weak Input Validation  

•⁠  ⁠Insecure Web Application Behavior

### ✅ Result

Successfully configured DVWA to Low security mode and performed hands-on vulnerability testing.

## 🧪 Vulnerabilities Tested

### 2️⃣ SQL Injection

**Description:**

Tested improper input sanitization in database queries.

**💉 Payload Example**

sql
1' OR '1'='1

### ✅ Result

Successfully manipulated backend query logic and retrieved multiple records.

## 3️⃣ Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 

*📌 Description*

Injected JavaScript into reflected user input fields.

*💉 Payload Example*

*HTML*

<script>alert('XSS')</script>

### ✅ Result

JavaScript executed successfully in browser popup.

## 4️⃣ Command Injection

*📌 Description*

Tested insecure server-side command execution through user input.

*💉 Payload Example*

127.0.0.1 && whoami

### ✅ Result

Additional system command executed successfully.

## 5️⃣ HTTP Request Interception

🛠️ Tool Used

Burp Suite

*📌 Description*

Captured and analyzed HTTP requests between browser and DVWA.

### ✅ Result

## 🔐 Security Recommendations

*SQL Injection Prevention*

Use parameterized queries

Validate input

Use least privilege DB accounts

*XSS Prevention*

Output encoding

Input sanitization

Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

*Command Injection Prevention*

Avoid shell execution

Sanitize inputs

Use allowlists

Run apps with least privileges

## 📚 Skills Gained
